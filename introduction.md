Introduction 

In our case study, we focused on the evolution of social media platforms, from where it all started with platforms like Six degrees to where we are today with platforms like TikTok and Facebook.  This development changed how billions of people around the world connect with each other but also had some negative drawbacks. 

We investigated this transition through two main viewpoints: Societal and ethical, we explored how this shift in social media development fundamentally changed the way people think and act in today's day and age and also the implications of social media such as certain effects on people’s mental health and behavioral shifts for instance decreased attention spans. 

This development is substantial because it shows the growth of social media over time and how for many people it has taken over their lives. It continues to shape the way people engage and even think about the world on a daily basis.
