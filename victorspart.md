#Ethical Reflection 
As social media has evolved from early apps such as email and Bulletin Board Systems to platforms that are used all around the world such as Facebook, Instagram and Reddit, it has changed how people communicate and entertain themselves. These changes bring many benefits but they also raise some ethical questions and concerns such as about privacy and power and fairness .

##Balancing connection and harm
Social media makes it easier than ever to stay connected through messages and calls which allow people to communicate with people across the world instantly allowing for people to experience things they may never find in real life. However the same features that are helping people with connections and information can also spread false information and narratives and harassment and hate instantly too. 
Which raises ethical questions like, who is responsible when people when it starts to effect people in a bad way, the platform that it was sent on or the user who was spreading hate, or both.It also raises the question of how far should platforms go in moderating content before it becomes censorship, and what happens to peoples mental health when they are constantly exposed to negativity, unrealistic expectations and having to compare themselves to others In order to ease these questions ethically platforms would have to design better reporting systems, they would also need harsher guidelines to reduce the reach of harmul content and make their moderation clear and consistent while also protecting freedom of speech. 

##Privacy, data and surveillance 
In this part I am going to talk about the ethical issues on how over time social media has changed from simple profiles to complicated systems that collect huge amounts of data such as locations, all your photos, your browsing history and even what it picks up from the microphone in your phone so it builds an algorithm for users. The ethical issues with this is that many people do not fully understand what data is collected when they consent to cookies and terms and conditions or how they are being used, this is usually because they are too long to read and confusing, Through this they think that their information would only be used to bring them videos that they like but it is more used for targeted data to benefit the company and for selling access to the users data. This is bad because even if the company is not selling their data if the data is leaked through a security breach peoples private data can be exposed that can lead to identity theft or harassment(blackmail). While things like VPN’s and two factor authentication can help protect privacy normal people usually would not think about using them which leaves a gap between people who can protect themselves and those who can not. Ethically I think companies should make privacy settings clearer and collect only the data they truly need and should tell users how they plan on using their information.

##Digital Divide 
I think social media has opened up a new way to go about education and work such as accessing online communities and apps to learn and study and remote jobs, However not everyone has equal access to good devices and stable internet to acquire good digital skills. This creates an ethical issue in a way that there is a digital divide for example some students can use platforms such as Youtube and Tiktok and Reddit to improve themselves faster while other students would be left behind, some people can build careers online like being a content creator or marketers while others can not benefit in the same way because of their situation. I think ethically governments, schools and companies have a responsibility to reduce this gap by improving access to technology so that social media does not increase in equality.

##Conclusion
The evolution of social media has brought huge benefits in communication, education and entertainment and work but it has also created a lot of complicated ethical challenges around privacy, power, inequality and mental health, reflecting on these issues is important because social media is not just a set of apps we use it can change we see our selves and how we see other people. I think an Ethical approach would be to constantly question who benefits from it, who is harmed by it and how we can change these platforms in a way that is respectful and responsible for everyone.
