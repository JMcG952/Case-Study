# Second Viewpoint Analysis 

Societal Viewpoint Analysis 

The societal viewpoint analysis is where I am going to be examining how the evolution of social media platforms affected society throughout the years through education, work, communication, entertainment, and privacy. 

 

# Communication 

Communication has so far thanks to the evolution of social media platforms, as nowadays social media is on nearly every device from phones to computers to smart watches, making it almost constantly accessible for a majority of people. 

Messages have become instant, so important information can travel instantly across the world. This includes images and videos as well.  

It allows people to join communities they may not have without social media and connect with others and their communities. 

Although many negatives have come from this easy to use communication, being the faster spread of misinformation, cyberbullying and less in person communication. 

 

# Education 

Education has been heavily impacted by the evolution of social media platforms over the years, for example through platforms like YouTube and TikTok information has become easier to get and understand through the countless tutorials which allow for students to understand information that they may not have understood before. 

Social media has also allowed for teachers to use many different types of teaching styles, such as through videos and posts, which can be a better way of learning for some students. 

Students can also get more engaged with the subjects they are interested in because the communities behind them are far more easily accessible for them through these social media platforms and their interactive features. 

It also allows for students to contact teachers with more ease for questions and help with work. 

However, one of the negatives is that not all students will have equal access to these platforms which could hurt them academically. 

We’ve also seen the example of these platforms being used way more during the covid-19 lockdowns, allowing for education to continue even when it couldn't be face to face. 

 

# Work 

The world of work has also been heavily impacted by the evolution of social media platforms. For starters, the evolution of social media platforms has created new jobs such as content creators or influencers, website designers and coders, social media marketers, and so many more. 

Social media platforms have allowed businesses to market themselves to a wider audience through ads and social media accounts. This leads to more people buying their products/services and allowing them to grow. 

Social media platforms have also been great for hiring employees because it allows for businesses to see more information about their potential employees and if they are the kind of person they are looking for through their posts and portfolios that may be public. 

Remote work has become a thing thanks to these platforms like teams, and zoom being used for communication which cuts out travel time which could increase productivity. 

However, some negatives could be that people's work, and non-work life could become too intertwined which some people don't like due to privacy reasons. 

 

# Entertainment 

Entertainment is on almost every social media platform nowadays, on Instagram there are reels, YouTube has long form and short form videos, TikTok has short form videos, and all of them have livestreams. 

Almost anybody can upload their videos meaning there is an endless pool of content for any kind of entertainment giving so much variety to users, such as songs, documentaries or live performances. 

The interactive features of social media also allows for the viewers to have a more interactive experience through the comments, polls, and trends. This allows for communities to be built and formed and is great for social interaction. 

The algorithm that has been introduced by the companies behind the social media platforms allow the users to get content that they may like based off previous interactions sent straight to them. This means the user gets a great viewing experience and the person who made the content gets their desired audience. 

 

# Privacy 

As social media platforms have grown, privacy risks have become much more common. This is one of the few areas of social media platforms that has a lot more negatives than positives. 

Some of the most notable positives of privacy from social media platforms over the last few years have been VPNS (virtual private network) and 2FA (two factor authentication). A VPN creates a secure encrypted tunnel between your device and the internet, and 2FA adds an extra layer of security, so not just a password is needed. 

The privacy risks on social media are largely the user's fault this is because users now often post pictures that may expose where they live, post information about themselves that could help narrow down where they are from, or just share their location with everyone on platforms such as Snapchat and Instagram.  

Another risk is users clicking on links on websites or emails without checking if it might be malicious. This can cause users to have their information stolen, letting people with almost always malicious intent to know everything about them.
